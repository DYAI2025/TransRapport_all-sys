I think we should focus on the quarterly results and how they align with our strategic objectives.

Yes, exactly! That makes perfect sense given the current market conditions.

So we both agree that the revenue targets are achievable within this timeframe.

Actually, I have some concerns about the implementation timeline. Let me clarify my position.

Can you explain what specific risks you're seeing in the Q4 projections?

I understand your concerns, and they're valid points that we need to address systematically.

Building on what you mentioned about market volatility, we should also consider the impact of seasonal trends.

We both recognize that flexibility will be key to our success in the coming months.

As we discussed earlier, the primary focus should remain on customer satisfaction metrics.

Remember when we talked about the importance of cross-functional collaboration? That principle applies here too.

Putting it together, I think we have a solid foundation for moving forward with confidence.

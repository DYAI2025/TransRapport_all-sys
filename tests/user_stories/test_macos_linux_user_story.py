User story validation test - macOS and Linux users

CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL before implementation.
Tests the complete user journey for macOS and Linux user installation.

macOS User Story: "As a macOS user, I want to download and install TransRapport 
by dragging from a DMG to Applications folder, so I can start using it immediately 
like any native Mac application."

Linux User Story: "As a Linux user, I want to install TransRapport using my 
distribution's package manager or AppImage, so I can use it without manual 
dependency management."

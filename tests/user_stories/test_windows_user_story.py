User story validation test - Windows user

CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL before implementation.
Tests the complete user journey for Windows 11 user installation.

User Story: "As a Windows 11 user, I want to download and install TransRapport 
with a simple double-click on an MSI installer, so I can start using the 
application immediately without technical configuration."

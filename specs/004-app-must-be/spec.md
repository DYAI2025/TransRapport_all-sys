# Feature Specification: Cross-Platform Easy Installation

**Feature Branch**: `004-app-must-be`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "app must be easy to install even for non-technical persons and musst be working on linux, mac and windows 11 as well"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A non-technical person needs to install the TransRapport constitutional analysis application on their computer (Linux, Mac, or Windows 11). They should be able to download and install the application without requiring technical knowledge, command-line usage, or system configuration. The installation process should be intuitive, guided, and result in a fully functional application that can be launched from their desktop or applications menu.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Windows 11 user visits the download page, **When** they download the installer and double-click it, **Then** the application installs with a standard Windows installation wizard and appears in the Start menu
2. **Given** a Mac user downloads the application, **When** they open the .dmg file and drag the app to Applications, **Then** the application is installed and accessible from Launchpad
3. **Given** a Linux user downloads the appropriate package, **When** they double-click the installer (AppImage, .deb, or .rpm), **Then** the application installs and appears in their applications menu
4. **Given** any user completes installation, **When** they launch the application for the first time, **Then** it starts successfully without requiring additional configuration or dependency installation
5. **Given** a user wants to uninstall the application, **When** they use their operating system's standard uninstall process, **Then** the application and all its components are completely removed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has insufficient disk space for installation?
- How does the system handle installation on unsupported OS versions (e.g., Windows 10, older Mac versions)?
- What occurs if required system permissions are denied during installation?
- How does the installer behave when antivirus software blocks the installation?
- What happens if the user tries to install over an existing installation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide native installer packages for Windows 11, macOS, and Linux distributions
- **FR-002**: System MUST complete installation through standard OS-specific installation flows (Windows installer wizard, Mac drag-to-Applications, Linux package managers)
- **FR-003**: Installation process MUST NOT require users to install additional dependencies manually
- **FR-004**: System MUST bundle all required runtime dependencies within the installer package
- **FR-005**: Application MUST be launchable immediately after installation without additional configuration
- **FR-006**: System MUST register itself in the operating system's applications menu/launcher
- **FR-007**: Installation process MUST provide clear progress indication and success confirmation
- **FR-008**: System MUST support standard uninstallation through OS-native uninstall mechanisms
- **FR-009**: Installer MUST validate system compatibility before beginning installation
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages for installation failures with suggested remediation
- **FR-011**: Installation package MUST be digitally signed to avoid security warnings [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: code signing certificates and distribution channels not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain file associations and desktop shortcuts after installation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific file types and shortcuts not defined]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Installation Package**: Native installer file (.msi for Windows, .dmg for Mac, .deb/.rpm/.AppImage for Linux) containing all application components and dependencies
- **Application Registry**: OS-specific registration entries that make the application discoverable in system menus and for uninstallation
- **System Dependencies**: Runtime libraries and frameworks required for application execution that must be bundled or verified during installation

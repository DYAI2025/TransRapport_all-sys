# Implementation Plan: Frontend Architecture for TransRapport Backend Interaction

**Branch**: `002-frontend-architecture-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-frontend-architecture-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a modern, user-friendly frontend interface that provides GUI access to the existing TransRapport CLI backend for documentation validation, cross-reference analysis, and terminology management. The frontend must integrate seamlessly with the proven CLI architecture while delivering an intuitive experience for documentation managers and developers.

## Technical Context
**User Requirements**: Create a user-friendly modern representative design that follows the architecture of the functionality and works as expected  
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (backend compatibility) + Svelte/SvelteKit (frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (backend bridge), Svelte/SvelteKit, SvelteUI, WebSocket (real-time updates)  
**Storage**: File-based (leverage existing CLI), SQLite for session state, browser local storage  
**Testing**: pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend), Playwright (E2E)  
**Target Platform**: Web browser (modern), responsive design for desktop and tablet
**Project Type**: web - frontend + backend bridge required  
**Performance Goals**: <2s validation feedback, <100ms UI responsiveness, handle 1000+ files  
**Constraints**: No backend CLI modifications, offline-capable, <50MB memory frontend  
**Scale/Scope**: Single user sessions, 10k+ files support, 5-10 main UI screens

**✅ All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved** via research.md

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Initial Check (Pre-Research)
**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (frontend, backend-bridge) - within limit
- Using framework directly? YES - FastAPI and frontend framework directly
- Single data model? YES - reuse CLI JSON schemas, no DTOs
- Avoiding patterns? YES - direct CLI subprocess calls, no complex abstractions

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? YES - frontend-bridge library, UI component library
- Libraries listed: [1] frontend-bridge (CLI integration), [2] ui-components (reusable UI)
- CLI per library: backend-bridge exposes --help/--version/--format, frontend serves CLI
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned for component documentation

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES - tests written before UI components
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES - TDD process mandatory
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? YES
- Real dependencies used? YES - actual CLI calls, real file system
- Integration tests for: CLI bridge, WebSocket communication, file handling
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase - ENFORCED

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? YES - JSON logs from both frontend and backend
- Frontend logs → backend? YES - WebSocket log streaming to unified backend log
- Error context sufficient? YES - CLI errors + frontend context + user actions

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0 (aligns with CLI backend version)
- BUILD increments on every change? YES
- Breaking changes handled? YES - parallel testing with CLI compatibility

### Post-Design Check (Phase 1 Complete)
**✅ VERIFIED POST-DESIGN**

After completing research and design phases:

**✅ Test-First Development**
- Contract tests generated for REST API and WebSocket protocols
- Quickstart provides comprehensive validation scenarios  
- TDD implementation path defined with failing tests first

**✅ Library-First Approach** 
- Svelte/SvelteKit chosen as proven, mature framework
- FastAPI selected for robust async/WebSocket support
- SvelteUI component library for professional UI
- No custom implementations where libraries exist

**✅ No CLI Modifications**
- Backend bridge maintains CLI as black box via subprocess calls
- Zero modifications to existing transrapport-docs command
- Full CLI feature coverage through JSON output parsing
- Preserves existing CLI architecture and stability

**✅ Constitution Compliance Score: 100%**
- All principles followed in design decisions
- Implementation plan maintains constitutional requirements
- Ready for task generation and TDD implementation

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - frontend + backend detected in requirements

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

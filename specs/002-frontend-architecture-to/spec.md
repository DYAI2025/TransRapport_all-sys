# Feature Specification: Frontend Architecture for TransRapport Backend Interaction

**Feature Branch**: `002-frontend-architecture-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "frontend architecture to to interact with the transrapport backend as expected"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description indicates need for frontend layer to communicate with existing TransRapport backend
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: End users, Frontend application, TransRapport backend system
   ‚Üí Actions: User interaction, Data presentation, Command execution, Status monitoring
   ‚Üí Data: Documentation validation results, Cross-reference reports, Terminology data
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must integrate with existing CLI-based backend architecture
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What type of frontend - web UI, desktop app, or mobile?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific backend features need frontend exposure?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Target user personas - developers, documentation managers, or end users?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Real-time vs batch interaction requirements?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User performs documentation validation through GUI
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on user-facing capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities (documentation, validation results, user sessions)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - multiple clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a documentation manager, I need a graphical interface to interact with the TransRapport documentation validation system so that I can efficiently manage documentation quality without requiring command-line expertise.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have documentation files to validate, **When** I access the frontend interface, **Then** I can browse and select files for validation
2. **Given** I have selected documentation files, **When** I initiate validation, **Then** I see real-time progress and results in a user-friendly format
3. **Given** validation has completed, **When** I review the results, **Then** I can see detailed error reports, cross-reference analysis, and terminology usage in an organized dashboard
4. **Given** I need to fix validation issues, **When** I interact with error reports, **Then** I can navigate directly to problematic content and understand required corrections
5. **Given** I manage multiple documentation projects, **When** I use the frontend, **Then** I can switch between projects and maintain separate validation contexts

### Edge Cases
- What happens when backend validation takes longer than expected?
- How does the frontend handle network connectivity issues with the backend?
- What occurs when validation results are too large to display efficiently?
- How does the system behave when backend CLI tools are unavailable or misconfigured?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a user interface for initiating documentation validation without requiring command-line knowledge
- **FR-002**: System MUST display validation results in a structured, searchable, and filterable format
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to view cross-reference analysis and terminology usage through the frontend interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide real-time feedback during validation processes with progress indicators
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to export validation reports in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, PDF)
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to configure validation settings [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific settings - strict mode, file filters, output formats?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with the existing TransRapport CLI backend without requiring backend modifications
- **FR-008**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multi-user access or single-user desktop application?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum file size and number of documents - performance constraints not specified]
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Save and restore validation sessions, or is this stateless?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User authentication and authorization levels not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Audit logs of user actions and validation history?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Validation Session**: Represents a user-initiated validation process with associated files, settings, and results
- **Documentation Project**: Collection of related documentation files that are validated together as a unit
- **Validation Result**: Structured data containing errors, warnings, cross-references, and terminology analysis from backend processing
- **User Profile**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User preferences, project access rights, and session history - depends on multi-user requirements]
- **Export Report**: Generated output containing validation results in user-requested format for sharing or archival

**Critical Blocking Dependencies:**
- All contract tests (T009-T028) must FAIL before any implementation starts
- T029-T035 (models) block T036-T057 (library implementations)  
- T036-T057 (libraries) block T066-T071 (Tauri bridge)
- T058-T065 (UI) requires T066-T071 (bridge commands)

- [x] Audio library: 4 contract tests (capture, import, monitoring, format)
- [x] Transcription library: 4 contract tests (ASR, diarization, quality, language)  
- [x] Analysis library: 5 contract tests (ATO, SEM, CLU, MEMA, rapport)
- [x] Export library: 4 contract tests (PDF, transcript, markers, metadata)
- [x] Storage library: 3 contract tests (sessions, transcripts, markers)

**✅ Entity Coverage:**
- [x] All 7 entities have model tasks: ConversationSession, AudioRecording, Transcript, SpeakerProfile, MarkerEvent, RapportIndicator, AnalysisReport

**✅ TDD Compliance:**
- [x] All contract tests (T009-T028) come before implementation (T036+)
- [x] Tests are designed to FAIL initially (no implementation exists)
- [x] Each library component has corresponding test task

**✅ Parallel Task Independence:**
- [x] Contract tests operate on different files
- [x] Models operate on different files  
- [x] Library implementations operate on different files
- [x] UI components operate on different files
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task

**✅ File Path Specificity:**
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] Paths follow desktop application structure
- [x] No vague or ambiguous task descriptions

**✅ Constitutional Compliance:**
- [x] Library-first approach: 5 distinct libraries (audio, transcription, analysis, export, storage)
- [x] Test-first development: Contract tests before implementation
- [x] No CLI modifications: Uses library interfaces only  
- [x] Privacy-first: All offline, encrypted storage, no network dependencies

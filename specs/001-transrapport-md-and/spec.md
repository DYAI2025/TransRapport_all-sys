# Feature Specification: TransRapport Core Architecture Documentation Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-transrapport-md-and`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "TRANSRAPPORT.md and use ARCHITECTURE.md and terminologie.md and Marker.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí User wants to integrate/use existing architecture documentation files
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Development team, CI/CD system, documentation users
   ‚Üí Actions: Reference documentation, maintain consistency, provide unified access
   ‚Üí Data: YAML markers, SQLite events, CLI commands, architectural guidelines
   ‚Üí Constraints: Offline-first, local-only, LD-3.4 compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should these documents be integrated - as reference only or active validation?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be automated checks to ensure consistency between documents?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: Developer accessing unified documentation during development
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on documentation accessibility and consistency
6. Identify Key Entities: Documentation files, Marker definitions, CLI interface
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding integration approach"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer working on the TransRapport system needs to access comprehensive, consistent documentation that covers the overall architecture (TRANSRAPPORT.md), detailed component architecture (ARCHITECTURE.md), terminology definitions (terminologie.md), and marker specifications (MARKER.md). The documentation should provide a clear, unified view of the system without contradictions or gaps.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer starts working on a new feature, **When** they need to understand the overall system architecture, **Then** they can access TRANSRAPPORT.md for high-level blueprint and incremental development plan
2. **Given** a developer needs detailed component information, **When** they consult ARCHITECTURE.md, **Then** they find comprehensive information about CLI interfaces, data models, and UI mappings that aligns with TRANSRAPPORT.md
3. **Given** a developer encounters unfamiliar terms, **When** they check terminologie.md, **Then** they find consistent definitions that match the usage in other documentation
4. **Given** a developer needs to create or validate markers, **When** they reference MARKER.md, **Then** they find clear guidelines that comply with LD-3.4 specifications mentioned in the architecture documents

### Edge Cases
- What happens when documentation files contain conflicting information?
- How does the system handle missing or outdated documentation references?
- What occurs when new marker types are introduced but not documented?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide unified access to all four core documentation files (TRANSRAPPORT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, terminologie.md, MARKER.md)
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST maintain consistency in terminology and architectural concepts across all files
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to navigate between related concepts across different documentation files
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that marker definitions comply with terminology and architectural guidelines
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST reflect the current state of the LD-3.4 marker pipeline (ATO ‚Üí SEM ‚Üí CLU ‚Üí MEMA)
- **FR-006**: CLI commands referenced in documentation MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: validated against actual implementation or remain as specification only?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: offline access requirement not specified - local files only or also need caching/indexing?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation File**: Represents each of the four core documentation files with metadata (path, version, last updated, dependencies)
- **Terminology Entry**: Represents definitions from terminologie.md with cross-references to usage in other documents
- **Architectural Component**: Represents system components described across TRANSRAPPORT.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Marker Definition**: Represents marker specifications from MARKER.md with validation rules and examples
